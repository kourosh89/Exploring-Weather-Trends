# Exploring-Weather-Trends
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. my goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live (Canada, British Colombia, Victoria)
